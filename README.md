# IMDB_Top_Actors
The Top 10 and Bottom 10 Actors based on reviews of films they acted in

This was a project using the IMDb data set on Kaggle conducted in R. 
The first task was to filter the dataset to films that were US made, had over 10,000 votes, and had been made in 1970 or later.
The second task was to separate the actors into their own rows and count them, thus providing each actor with the number of films they had been in within the new data set.
Only actors who had been in at least 25 films since 1970 were retained.
The next task was to average the average ratings that each of those films had recieved and assign that average to each actor. If the actor had been in a highly rated film and a poorly rated film whatever the average of those average film ratings would be assigned to the actor.
The final task was to chart the results and provide a reference marker for the mean averge rating for all actors
